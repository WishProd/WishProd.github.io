Hello, my name is Callum and I have a passion for audio production. I recently graduated from the Kingston University of London with a 2.1 Honnors Degree in Audio Production. I have experience in various aspects of sound design, editing, mixing and mastering. I am looking for an opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting and to learn from experienced mentors. I am proficient in using various software and hardware tools for audio production and I am eager to explore new technologies and techniques. I have a portfolio of some of my previous projects that showcase my abilities and creativity. I would love to hear from you and discuss how I can contribute to your team and your goals.
